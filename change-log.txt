Updated to produce 'dynamic' types in decoded data object.

This eliminates the need to cast elements when you use them.
It also enables you to print an element without concern for the type.
(Have a look at 'json-test.cs')

The parser will return a type which is the type of the top-level value

This will (usually) be of type
    -JDict  - {"Name":Value, ...} which is a .Net   Dictionary<string,dynamic> object
    -JArray - [Value, Value, ...] which is a .Net   List<dynamic> object
    
It is usually one of these, but in trivial cases could be any valid Value type including
    -string
    -double
    -long
    -bool
    -null
    
You can assign any item to a 'var' or 'dynamic' typed variable
If you know what type a value is you can assign it to a typed variable.
